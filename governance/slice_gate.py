"""Slice gate -- mechanical enforcement of the PR <-> slice-issue contract.

This gate blocks a PR that:

  1.  Does not cite its slice issue via Closes/Fixes/Resolves #N. The
      closing set must contain exactly one slice-labelled issue; a
      second reference is permitted only for the slice's parent PRD
      under rule 9.
  2.  Cites a number that does not resolve in the repo.
  2a. Cites a number that resolves to a pull request rather than an issue
      (GitHub's issues endpoint also returns PRs).
  3.  Cites an issue that is not in the OPEN state.
  4.  Cites an issue that lacks the ``slice`` label.
  5.  Has a title that does not byte-equal the cited issue's title.
  6.  Cites an issue whose body is missing any full multi-line
      Significance blockquote from the slice template (byte-equal
      substring check).
  7.  Has a diff that touches any file not matched by a glob in the
      cited issue's ``Surfaces`` section.
  8.  Has a diff that touches any file matched by a glob in the cited
      issue's ``Out of Scope`` section.
  9.  Has a closing set that violates PRD closure: while the cited
      slice's parent PRD (native sub-issue parent) has other open
      slice sub-issues, the set must be exactly {slice}; when the
      cited slice is the parent's last open slice sub-issue, exactly
      {slice, parent PRD}; a slice with no parent PRD requires exactly
      {slice}.
  10. Cites a slice with a Done Means checkbox neither checked
      (``- [x]``) nor overruled (``OVERRULED: <reason>``). The
      post-merge evidence fields (Merge SHA, Merged PR number, the
      run-id list) are not checkboxes and are exempt pre-merge; they
      are written by ``slice_closeout_guard`` when a merged PR closes
      the issue.

Rules 6 and 7 together bind the template and the issue: the template's
Significance notes cannot drift away from what the validator demands
(rule 6 reads the template at runtime and asserts every blockquote is
in the issue verbatim), and the scope the issue declares cannot be
exceeded by the PR (rule 7 checks the PR diff against the issue's own
Surfaces globs).

Usage:

  python governance/slice_gate.py \
    --pr-title "<pr title>" \
    --pr-body-file <path> \
    --pr-files-file <path>         # one path per line
    --template <path>              # .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/slice.yml
    --repo <owner>/<name>

Exit codes:

  0 -- all gates pass
  1 -- one or more gates failed
  2 -- gate itself could not run (bad args, gh failure, etc.)
